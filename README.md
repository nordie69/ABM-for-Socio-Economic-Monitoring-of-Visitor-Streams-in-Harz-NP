# ABM for Socio-Economic Monitoring of Visitor Streams in Harz NP

## Main goal
The goal of this model is to simulate groups of hikers in the study area around the Brocken, in the Harz NP. As a result, national park management will be provided with key figures (e.g. numbers of visitors to POIs, of hikers on paths) for socio-economic monitoring.

## Programming language
This agent-based model (ABM) is written in GAMA. To run this code you need GAMA 1.8 or higher. Futher information is available here: https://gama-platform.github.io/

## File structure
### Directory include
Includes all necessary data (e.g. shapefiles).

### Directory models
Main program directory. There is only one file with all subroutines together.

### Directory tests
Several tests and code snippets which have been used during the development of this ABM.

### Directory output
Simulation generated output of the results from the ABM will be placed here. Actually there are no files in here, because you havent't run any simulation now.
