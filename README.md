# ABM for Socio-Economic Monitoring of\nVisitor Streams in Harz NP
 The goal of this model is to simulate groups of hikers in the study area around the Brocken, in the Harz NP. As a result, national park management will be provided with key figures (e.g. numbers of visitors to POIs, of hikers on paths) for socio-economic monitoring.
